          <h1 id="h1-0">Angular</h1>
          <h2 id="h2-0">Install</h2>
          <p>Requires Node for packing and optimize the project. Also npm will be used download all the dependencies and angualar cli itself.</p>
          
          <p><samp>npm install -g @angular/cli</samp> : Install angular Cli</p>
          
          <p><samp>ng new my-app</samp> : Create a new project</p>
          
          <p><samp>ng serve</samp> : Serve or run the new project at port 4200 on local host with development server active, that is the server will refresh app whenever we save some files and changes are detected in those files. The <samp>ng serve --open</samp> flag will open the default browser at localhost:4200.</p>
          
          <p>As angular cli sets up the project with a package.json file and we have npm installed with node, we can set up <samp>npm start</samp> command with required setup.</p>
          
          <h2 id="h2-1">Bootstrap</h2>
          <p>Adding bootstrap to our angular project.</p>
          
          <p>With bootstrap download the bootstrap dependency <samp>npm install --save bootstrap@3</samp>.</p>
          
          <p>In angular.json in the root of our project, add the location of the bootstrap dependency.</p>
          
          <p>In "styles" array add: <samp>node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"</samp>.</p>
          
          <h2 id="h2-2">Components</h2>
          <p>The angular cli helps us set up different components, modules and services to get us started.</p>
          
          <p>We can use <samp>ng generate &lt;schematic&gt; [options]</samp> to get started with basic code for that schematic.</p>
          
          <p>To generate components we use <samp>ng generate component nameForComponent</samp> or short <samp>ng g c nameOfComponent</samp>. The component is added in the <samp>src\app</samp> folder. We can specify a relative location with the name to add the component that location. To create a component named <samp>image</samp> inside <samp>gallery</samp> directory we will use <samp>ng g c gallery/image</samp>, so the new Components files will be placed in <samp>src\app\gallery\image</samp>.</p>
          
          <p>While we generate a component with the cli we can use <samp>--skipTests true</samp> so that the test <samp>.spec.ts</samp> is not created.</p>
          
          <h3 id="h3-0">HTML template</h3>
          <p>Directly in the component.ts file :</p>
          
          
          <pre><code class="language-ts">
          @Component({
              selector: 'aap-servers',
              //This is html template that will be used with this component
              //We in this case do not need to define a new html file to hold the template for the compnent.
              template: &lsquo;&lt;app-server&gt;&lt;/app-server&gt;&lsquo;,
              styleUrl: ['./servers.component.css']
          })
          </code></pre>
          
          <p>Even so this method is not recommened as it can get very complex even if we write a relatively small amount of code.</p>
          
          <p>The other mehods is to add templateUrl that holds the relative location of the html template we want to use with the component script file.</p>
          
          <h3 id="h3-1">Styles</h3>
          <p>Similar to html templates direcly defined above we can also define our css by defining it in the component script file.</p>
          
          <p><samp>styles: [' h3{ color: dodgerblue; } ']</samp></p>
          
          <p>Or we can do it as it is recommended by the cli and use the component.css file create by the angular cli when we generate a component.</p>
          
          <p>Note :</p>
          <p>Angular Enforces style encapsulation that means that a css property defined for one component is not applied to other component even if the component is a child component of the component where the style is defined.</p>
          
          <p>Angular does that by adding a custom property to all the elements of the particular component and adding style to that property.</p>
          
          <p>This is done so that the page is supported on older browser that might not support shadow DOM that is implemented by modern browser that supports styles to be added to individual components and then be displayed.</p>
          
          <p>This style Encapsulation behaviour of a component can be changed by adding <samp>encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None</samp> to the <samp>@Component</samp> declaration of the component that we dont need encapsulation for.</p>
          
          <p>We can also choose <samp>Native</samp> as the porperty for the encapsulation which will use the Shadow DOM behaviour of the browers that support it. But we dont want to use it as there are browsers that might not support it especially the older version of the common browers.</p>
          
          <p>The default value for <samp>encapsulation</samp> is <samp>Emulated</samp> which is the default behaviour as discussed above and does not need to be specified.</p>
          
          <h3 id="h3-2">Selector</h3>
          <p>Selectors can be html tags, or class or id.</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li> Normal Selector defined when generated is a html element.</li>
          </ul><p>  <samp>selector: 'app-servers'</samp>  <samp>&lt;app-servers&gt;&lt;/app-servers&gt;</samp></p>
          
          <ul>
            <li> Attribute :</li>
          </ul><p>  <samp>selector: '[app-servers]</samp>  <samp>&lt;div app-servers&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</samp></p>
          
          <ul>
            <li> Class :</li>
          </ul><p>  <samp>selector: '.app-servers'</samp>  <samp>&lt;div class="app-servers"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</samp></p>
          
          <p>All of the above selectors can be used to get similar results.</p>
          
          <h2 id="h2-3">Data Binding</h2>
          <ul>
            <li> String Interpolation :</li>
          </ul>
          <p><samp>value: string = This string will be displayed</samp></p>
          <p><samp>{{ value }}</samp> : This we put in HTML file.</p>
          
          <p>Any value which at the end can be resolved to a string can be used here. But a multiline expresson cannot be used here.</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li> Property Binding</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Binding To properties in HTML.</p>
          
          <p><samp>&lt;button class="btn btn-primary" [disabled]="allowNewServer"&gt;Add Server&lt;/button&gt;</samp></p>
          <p><samp>allowNewServer:boolean = false</samp></p>
          
          <p>In the above html code we create a button. In it <samp>disable</samp> is a property of the button and default html code. It is not related to angular. The disable property will disable the button and we will not be able to click it.</p>
          
          <p>In the above code we bind the disable property to the varible <samp>allowNewServer</samp> which is a variable in our js code.</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li> Event Binding</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Similar to property binding we can bind to any event provided by that HTML element.</p>
          
          <p>We use <samp>()</samp> to bind to the event as we used <samp>[]</samp> to bind to the properties.</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li> Bindable Properties and Events</li>
          </ul>
          <p>How do you know to which Properties or Events of HTML Elements you may bind? You can basically bind to all Properties and Events - a good idea is to <samp>console.log()</samp> the element you're interested in to see which properties and events it offers.</p>
          
          <p>Important: For events, you don't bind to onclick but only to click <samp>(=&gt; (click))</samp>.</p>
          
          <p>The MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) offers nice lists of all properties and events of the element you're interested in. Googling for <samp>YOUR_ELEMENT</samp> properties or <samp>YOUR_ELEMENT</samp> events should yield nice results.</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li> Events</li>
          </ul>
          
          <pre><code class="language-ts">
          //We get a event from the event binding in the html.
          onUpdateServerName(event: Event){
              //This will expilicitely tell ts that we know that this is the html event property.
              this.serverName = &lt;HTMLInputElement&gt;event.target.value;
          
          
          }
          </code></pre>
          
          <ul>
            <li> ngModel : Twp Way binding Directive</li>
          </ul>
          <p>NgModel is used for two way databinding and is a directive provided by angular.</p>
          
          <p><samp>ngModel</samp> is not a part of the core module of angular and needs to be imported by adding the <samp>FormsModule</samp> to the <samp>imports[]</samp> array in the AppModule.</p>
          <p>Then also need to add the import from <samp>@angular/forms</samp> in the app.module.ts file:</p>
          
          <p><samp>import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';</samp></p>
          
          <ul>
            <li> Two way Data Binding :</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="h2-4">Directives</h2>
          <h3 id="h3-3">Structural Directives : Build In</h3>
          <p>In structural directives we use <samp>&lt;em&gt;</samp> to indicate that the directive is a structural directive. The star is not only there to tell the other programs that read the code that it is a structural directive but also to angular as angular need to change the code that in wrapped in the structural directive to from the code that it understands. <samp>&lt;/em&gt;</samp> by itself is not a functional part of angular, but a way for us to write the code more inituitively.</p>
          
          <p>So the code <samp>*</samp> gets converted into an ng-template that angular understands.</p>
          
          
          <pre><code class="language-html">
          &lt;div &lowast;ngIf="!onlyOdd"&gt;
            &lt;li &lowast;ngFor="let even of evenNumbers"&gt;{{even}}&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          
          
          &lt;!--The above code will be converted to the following code and similar for the ngFor inisde the existing code.--&gt;
          &lt;ng-template [ngIf]="!onlyOdd"&gt;
            &lt;li &lowast;ngFor="let even of evenNumbers"&gt;{{even}}&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;/ng-template&gt;
          
          
          &lt;!--Now we see that we dont have the star and the ngIf is bound as a property instead--&gt;
          </code></pre>
          
          <p>Note: We cannot have more than one structural directive on any one html element.</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li> \*ngIf :</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The <samp>*</samp> in the directive name tells that this directive will change the DOM and is a <strong>structural directive</strong>.</p>
          
          <p>The value \*ngIf should be set to an expression that return a boolean value.</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li> \*ngIf with Else :</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The ngStyle by itself does not require the <samp>[]</samp> but was we are binding a value from our component.ts file to the style we need them. In the example above we bind the value from our script file to the backgroundColor Property of the ngStyle.</p>
          
          <ul>

          <p>Even if in the above example we change the style of our html element directly by using the reference to the element in our script file it is not recommened.</p>
          
          <p>The better approach to changing the DOM from the script file is to use <samp>Renderer</samp> to make the style changes that we want to make. This is important as in some use cases like in services(Not referering to angular services here but general service programs) we might not have access to the DOM element.</p>

          <p>As we see in the previous section example we dont have to have <samp>[]</samp> to surround the directive selector but as we have named our @Input main property that the directive needs to achive to the name of the selector we have to now put the selector of the directive in the <samp>[]</samp>.</p>
          
          <p>We also see that we put the _red_ in double quotes and then single quotes, that is to signify that it is a string.</p>
          
          <p>We can also bind to the properties direcly by omitting <samp>[]</samp> but only in the case that we are passing in a string and we also omit the single quotes that surround the string. But while using this case it should be very clear that it is not a native property of the element for other who read the code and also angular itself.</p>
          
          <h3 id="h3-8">Renderer</h3>
          <p>The above example shows the use of renderer to change the property background color of the host html element. As it is recommended that we should not change host elmenents properties, values and style from our script we use the renderer to change the properties, and styles for us.</p>
          
          <p>A lot more can be done with the renderer than just change the style of the element. All the methods of the Renderer can be refered to <a href="https://angular.io/api/core/Renderer2" target="_blank">here : Renderer2</a>.</p>
          
          <h3 id="h3-9">@HostBinding and @HostListener</h3>
          <p>The above example show Hostbinding and HostListener in action.</p>
          
          <p>HostBinding let us bind with the properties of the hosting html element.</p>
          
          <p>HostListener listenes for the events that the html element my supports.</p>
          
          <h3 id="h3-10">@HostListener</h3>
          <p>Decorator that declares a Dom Event to listen for, is placed over a method that is invoked when the dom event is triggered. The decorator can be declared with different dom events such as <samp>click</samp> on the component, <samp>mouseenter</samp> and also window events such as <samp>window:keydown.enter</samp> or <samp>window:resize</samp> etc.</p>
          
          
          <pre><code class="language-ts">
          import { HostListener, Component } from "@angular/core";
          
          
            @HostListener('window:keydown.enter', ['$event'])
            handleKeyDown(event: KeyboardEvent) {

          <h2 id="h2-5">Debugging Angular</h2>
          <p>A Tool named augury can be used to debug the angular code easily in chrome. It is a chrome extension and give wide and easy debugging options.</p>
          
          <h2 id="h2-6">Custom Property and Event Binding</h2>
          <p>We need to import @Input and @Output from @angular/core to use them in our components.</p>
          
          <h3 id="h3-11"><samp>@Input()</samp></h3>
          <p>The @Input() allows the child component that is hosted in our parent component, where the property that we want to access is defined, to use this property.</p>
          
          <p>So basically properites of parent component can be accessed by child component by using @Input().</p>
          
          <p><samp>@Input() element: {type: string, name: string};</samp></p>
          
          <p>We can also set an alias to the property, put simply we can pass to input a name that will be used to bind to the property.</p>
          
          <p><samp>@Input('serverElement') element: {type: string, name: string};</samp></p>
          
          <p><samp>[serverElement]="serverElementCreated"</samp></p>
          
          <p>So as shown above we can bind to the name serverElement to access the property element in the parent component. Now that we have given then property an alias we cannot bind to the property with its original name.</p>
          
          <h3 id="h3-12"><samp>@Output()</samp></h3>
          <p>The @Output() helps us to bind to a property in our child component and pass the data to the parent component to be used.</p>
          
          <p>So basically opposite flow of @Input().</p>
          
          <p>@Input() : Parent ==> Child</p>
          <p>@Output() : Child ==> Parent.</p>
          
          <p><samp>(serverCreated)="onServerAdded($event)</samp></p>
          
          <p>This is the code we will use in the app-component tag in the html to bind to the property from the child class and pass data with <samp>event</samp> to the parent class.</p>
          
          <p>As we see above out onServerAdded method needs an event paramenter. That means serverCreated should emmit an event.</p>
          
          <p>To do that we have create a property in our child class that is of type event emiiter.</p>
          
          <p><samp>@Output() hiyserverCreated = new EventEmitter&lt;{ServerName: string, serverContent: string}&gt;()</samp></p>
          
          <p>This will create a new object of type EventEmitter and we also pass in the type of object that the event emitter will emit.</p>
          
          <p>Now that we have create the event emitter object we want to create a method that will actually emit the event from the child to be used in the parent.</p>
          
          
          <pre><code class="language-ts">
          onAddServer(){
              //The emit method takes the object that will be emitted by the event emitter when called.
              this.serverCreated.emit({
                  serverName: this.newServerName,
                  serverContent: this.newServerContent
              });
          }
          </code></pre>
          
          <p>Similar to @Input we can also pass @Output a name so that the name can be used to bind to the property from the parent component.</p>
          
          <h3 id="h3-13">Local Reference to the HTML element</h3>
          <p><samp>#</samp> is used to create a local reference in an element.</p>
          
          <p><samp>&lt;input type="text" c;ass="form-control" #LocalElementReferenceName&gt;</samp></p>
          
          <p>Note : Local References can only be used in the html template and not in the type script code of the component.</p>
          
          <p>The local Reference will give us access to the element it self. For example if we create a local reference to an input field as shown above we will have access to the field itself and not its value direclty. But we can get the value of the input form the element that we get reference to by using <samp>referenceName.value</samp>.</p>
          
          <p>In our script file if the local reference is passed as a parameter can specify the type of the arguments as <samp>HTMLInputElement</samp> for the above line of code example.</p>
          
          <h3 id="h3-14">@ViewChild()</h3>
          <p><samp>@ViewChild('serverContentInput', {static: true}) serverContentInput: ElementRef;</samp></p>
          
          <p>The same change (add <samp>{ static: true }</samp> as a second argument) needs to be applied to ALL usages of <samp>@ViewChild()</samp> (and also <samp>@ContentChild()</samp> which you'll learn about later) IF you plan on accessing the selected element inside of <samp>ngOnInit()</samp>.</p>
          
          <p>If you DON'T access the selected element in ngOnInit (but anywhere else in your component), set <samp>{ static: false }</samp> instead!</p>
          
          <p>If you're using Angular 9, you only need to <samp>add { static: true }</samp> (if needed) but not <samp>{ static: false }</samp>.</p>
          
          <p>To Use <samp>@ViewChild()</samp> we have to pass the local reference to the ViewChild as a paramenter which will be used as a _selector_ for the element in HTML.</p>
          
          <p>Unlike the above example where we pass the local referce to a method as a paramenter and get the html element itself in our script file, we get a <samp>ElementRef</samp> as the type which need to be imported form angular core.</p>
          
          <p>Note: Even if we can get the html element in our script file it is not recommended to change the value of any other property of the html element directly throught the reference. We can use directives to change the value.</p>

          <h2 id="h2-7">Services And Dependency Injection</h2>
          <p>Note: The Service is defined with <samp>@Injectable()</samp>. Every angular class that we need to inject a service into needs to have a metadata defined about it. For Componenets it is @Componenet, but services by themselves do not have any metadata defined for them. Thus to inject a service into another service the service in which another service is to be injected need to have an <samp>@Injectable()</samp> to define the metadata for the service.</p>
          
          <p>With the later versions of angular it is standart practice to define to define a service with <samp>@Injectable()</samp>.</p>
          
          <p>From Angular 6 onwards we do not have to have providers defined in the app-modules.ts file as the service direcly defines it in metadata in the <samp>@Injectable()</samp> that it needs to be instanciated in the root of the project.</p>

          <ol>
            <li> Template Driven : Angular Infers thte form Object from the DOM.</li>
          </ol>
          <ol>
            <li> Reactive : From is created programmatically and synchronized with the DOM.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Template Driven forms are suitable for small, simple forms, while reactive forms are used for complex forms due to its scalability.</p>

            <th>REACTIVE</th>
            <th>TEMPLATE-DRIVEN</th>

            <td>Implicit, created by directives</td>

            <td>Data model Structured and immutable</td>
            <td>Unstructured and mutable</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>

          </tr>
          </table>
          <h3 id="h3-25">Common From Foundation Classes</h3>
          <ul>
            <li> FormControl : Track the value and validation status of an individual form control.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li> FromGroup : Track the same value and status for a group of form controls.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li> FormArray : Track the same value and status for an array of form controls.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li> ControlValueAccessor : Creates a bridge between the angular FormControl and the inbuild DOM elements.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="h3-26">Template Driven Forms</h3>
          <p>Import FormsModule in the NgModule -> imports[] -> FormsModule in the app.module.ts file to use the approach.</p>
          
          <p>Angulars template driven use <strong>Two way Data binding</strong> to update the data model component and changes are made in the template and visa versa.</p>
          
          <p>Angular does not detect the form controls automatically so we have to make angular aware of the form control. This is done by using <samp>ngModel</samp> which is a part of FormsModule.</p>
          
          <p>The <samp>NgModel</samp> creates and manages a instance of <samp>FormControl</samp> for the given element that it is put on.</p>
          
          <p>There are two ways we can use use template driven forms.</p>
          
          <p>First way we can direclty use <samp>ngModel</samp> and with a varible in our script component that will track the value of the FormControl.</p>
          
          <p>This ways can mostly be used for 1 or 2 input fields and to directly capture their values without complexity.</p>
          
          <quote> Don't Forget to add <samp>FormsModule</samp> from <samp>'@angular/forms'</samp> in <samp>app.module.ts</samp> while using the template driven forms.</quote>
          
          <pre><code class="language-ts">
          import { Component } from "@angular/core";
          
          
          @Component({
            selector: "app-template-form",
            template: &lsquo; Name : &lt;input type="text" [(ngModel)]="name" /&gt; &lsquo;,
          })
          export class TemplateForm {
            public name = "";
          }
          </code></pre>
          
          <p>The second way involves using the ngModel to mark FormControl and creating a form with a submit button.</p>
          
          <quote> To mark the form for template driven approach we use the <samp>ngForm</samp> directive and it needs to be set as the value for our form's local reference.</quote>
          <p>Lets take an example of a contact form. We have three fields Name, Email and Message.</p>
          
          
          <pre><code class="language-html">
          &lt;!-- Template --&gt;
          &lt;form id="container" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()" #contactForm="ngForm"&gt;
            &lt;label&gt;If you would like to contact me please use the form.&lt;/label&gt;
          
          
            &lt;label&gt;Name&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;input name="name" ngModel /&gt;
            &lt;label&gt;Email&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;input name="email" ngModel /&gt;
            &lt;br /&gt;
            &lt;label&gt;Message&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;textarea name="message" ngModel&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
            &lt;br /&gt;
            &lt;button type="submit"&gt;Send&lt;/button&gt;
          &lt;/form&gt;
          </code></pre>
          
          <quote> Note the button used to submit the form, should be marked with <samp>type="sumbit"</samp>.</quote>
          
          <pre><code class="language-ts">
          export class ContactComponent implements OnInit {
            @ViewChild("contactForm") public contactForm!: NgForm;
          
          
            constructor() {}
            ngOnInit(): void {}
          
          
            public onSubmit(): void {
              console.log(this.contactForm.form.value);
              //will print to console the values object.
            }
          }
          </code></pre>
          
          <p>In the above example we are using <samp>@ViewChild</samp> to get the value for the form, but we could also pass the value as an argument to the <samp>onSubmit()</samp> method.</p>
          
          <p>We just need to pass the local reference (<samp>contactForm</samp> in the above example) to the method and have our <samp>onSubmit(contactForm: NgForm)</samp> with NgForm as its parameter.</p>
          
          <p>The we can access the value of each of the fields in our form with <samp>formName.form.value</samp>.</p>
          
          <quote> Note that <samp>ngForm</samp> can only be used with a form element and not with a div, if we use a div to wrap our FormControls.</quote>
          <h3 id="h3-27">Validation</h3>
          <p>Some Build in properties of the HTML like required can be used to validate the form.</p>
          
          <p>There are also directive provided by angular that can be used to validate the form input such as email.</p>
          
          <p>The are not a definitive check though as the front end application can be tricked, there should always be validation of data on server side so that we dont get invalid data in our persistance.</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li> <a href="https://angular.io/api/forms/Validators" target="_blank">Build in validators</a> : These are all built-in validators, though that are the methods which actually get executed(and which can be add when using the reactive approach).</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li> <a href="https://angular.io/api?type=directive" target="_blank">Build in directives</a> : Everything marked with "D" is a directive and can be added to your template.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Additionally, you might also want to enable HTML5 validation (by default, Angular disables it). You can do so by adding the <samp>ngNativeValidate</samp> to a control in your template.</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li> NgModel :</li>
          </ul>
          <p>NgModel can be used with local reference to the form control.</p>
          
          <p>We can also have a default value for the control including <samp>&lt;Select&gt;</samp> as shown below.</p>
          
          <p><samp>[ngModel]="pet"</samp></p>
          
          <p>The above example above shows one way binding and we can also use NgModel with two way binding.</p>
          
          <p><samp>[(ngModel)]= "answer"</samp> : answer is a property of the script that the html element is placed on.</p>
          
          <p>We can then use interpolation else were where we want to print the value of the answer property.</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li> Grouping from Controls</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We can put <samp>ngModelGroup="controlGroup"</samp> on a div that holds the form controls that need to be grouped.</p>
          
          <p>This will create a individual object like the form object that we get for the group and thus we can assess the validity of the from and values of the group independently.</p>
          
          <p>We can also put a Local Reference on the group div and get access to the group object in our script as well as other places in the template itself.</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li> Setting an patching values</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We can set default valies to our from controls, by using the <samp>patchValue</samp> method of <samp>form</samp>.</p>
          
          
          <pre><code class="language-ts">
          const suggestedName = "SuperUser";
          
          
          this.signupForm.form.patchValue({
            userData: {
              username: suggestedName,
            },
          });
          </code></pre>
          
          <p>The above approach to set the value for the form on an event will not reset the whole form, just set the value of the form element that we want to target.</p>
          
          <p>The Other approach might be to set the value directly by using <samp>this.signupForm.setValue({})</samp> and pass in the object with the values that we want ot add to our from, but it will reset the form and thus all the values that the user had entered and thus the above approach is much more convenient and useful in most cases.</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li> Resetting Form</li>
          </ul>
          <p><samp>this.signupForm.reset();</samp> this will reset the form to empty as if the page was reloaded and the form was never used.</p>
          
          <p>If we want the form to have defualt values set as we set wtih <samp>setValues</samp>, we could pass in the object to the reset property and the default values will be set as if we were to use the setValues property after the form is reset.</p>
          
          <h3 id="h3-28">Reactive Approach</h3>
          <p>In the reactive approach we create the from programatically.</p>
          
          <p>In NgModules we need <samp>ReactiveFromsModule</samp> to be added to the <samp>imports[]</samp>. We do not need the NgFormModule that we used in the previous template driven apprach.</p>

          <h2 id="h2-16">Lazy Loading And other Optimizations</h2>
          <p>This is used for optimization.</p>
          
          <p>We need multiple modules, that is our app should be divided into multiple modules to take advantage of Lazy Loading.</p>
          
          <p>This will help us bundle the code in smaller parts and download only the required files when we start the code and as we use.</p>
          
          <quote> Note : The example below shows the modern way of declaring route for lazing loading in the appRoutes. For older version we can delcare it as <samp>{ path: 'recipes', loadChildren: './recipes/recipes.module#RecipesModule' }</samp>. Only use this if the using older version of angular and the new apprach does not work as this older appraoch will give errors and might even bug the application while using newer version of angular.</quote>
          <p>Things to check when lazy loading component :</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li> Declare the route path to the component that need to be lazy loaded as <samp>{ path: 'recipes', loadChildren: ()=&gt; import('./recipes/recipes.module').then(m=&gt;m.RecipesModule)}</samp></li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li> Remove the declaration of the component we are trying to lazy load from the app.module.ts file as we are trying to lazy load it and if we have a decalaration in the main file we will be trying to also actively load it.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li> Now we chagne the path that point to 'recipes' in our Recipes.module.ts or recipes.routes.ts file to be ''(empty string) as we have added that route to our main routes file as shown above.</li>

          <p>Use <samp>ng build --prod</samp> to compile the application and let angular perform the optimization that it can to get it production ready.</p>
          
          <h3 id="h3-39">Ahead of time compilation</h3>
          <p>Just-In-Time Compilation :</p>
          
          <p>When we are developing our app the template code that is the html has part of angular specific commands that need to be complied so that our brower can display them as they should. These commands are complied during development at the time the app runs in our browser just before it is displayed by angular template compiler which is shipped with our code while development.</p>
          
          <p>But this complier is big and should not be a part of our production application as it increases the size of our application significantly and thus increase load times.</p>
          
          <p>Thus we use Ahead of time compliation to compile these files before we upload the application to the server to make the application production ready.</p>
          
          <p>This removes the need for the angular just in time complier to be shipped wiht our production app making the size of our app payload significantly smaller and also does other optimization that make the overall file size of our files smaller.</p>
          
          <h2 id="h2-18">Setting Up Proxy Server</h2>
          <p>During development we could have our backend running online or on a different localhost port. When we send a http request to our backend through our brower the browser actually sends a _Preflight Request_ which is a request with a header for the backend to check if the frontend application has permissions to send the request and whether the backend will allow the operation that the request will contain.</p>
          
          <p>In many cases when we use Spring or many other backend frameworks this will not be supported as Spring does not allow preflight request and will give us rather the browser a CORS(Cross Origin Resource Sharing) error.</p>
          
          <quote> Note : Postman will not get such errors because Postman does not send preflight requests but our browsers do.</quote>
          <p>To fix this we can set up a proxy server.</p>
          
          <quote> Note : Proxy servers will only work during developement that is they work with <samp>ng serve</samp> which set up a developement server and not with <samp>ng build</samp>. So we have to change our backend if are going to host our frontend on a different domain than that of our backend. For Spring boot it can be done by using : <samp>@CrossOrigin(origins = "http://localhost:4200")</samp> over our <samp>@RequestMapping</samp>.</quote>
          <p>For an Indetail explanation on creating proxy Servers <a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/setup-a-proxy-for-api-calls-for-your-angular-cli-app-6566c02a8c4d" target="_blank">visit</a>.</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li> Create <samp>proxy.conf.json</samp> in our project root that is in the same folder as <samp>package.json</samp>.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li> We write our proxy Configuration in the file.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <pre><code class="language-json">
          {

          }
          </code></pre>
          
          <p>Now to start our development server with the proxy configuration we do <samp>ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json</samp>.</p>
          
          <p>We can set up <samp>"start": "ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json"</samp> in our package.json so that we dont have to type it every time we want to start the server, we can just use <samp>npm start</samp> and npm will run the command for us.</p>

          <p>Sometimes you may want to act on how the package is done, add a plugin or you are simply curious to see the Webpack configuration on which it is based.</p>
          
          <p>When running ng eject, you generate a webpack.config.json file. Looking at the file package.json you will see that the commands to launch have slightly changed:</p>
          
          <p><samp>ng serve</samp> --> npm start</p>
          <p><samp>ng build</samp> --> npm run build</p>
          <p><samp>ng e2e</samp> --> npm run e2</p>
          
          <p>If you want to undo <samp>ng eject</samp>, you will have to edit your .angular.cli.json file and set ejected to false:</p>

          <p>The altenative to innerHTML when we just want to render text and not execute the _markup_, we could use <samp>textContent</samp>. As we know we want the code to show and not have any markup execute from the html we could use this approach.</p>
          
          
          <pre><code class="language-js">

          <p>Angular removes any content from the innerHtml that might leave our application vunnerable to arracks due to scripts executing from external sources. This is called DomSanatization.</p>

          <p>In the following example we get a file from the server that has html and css.</p>
